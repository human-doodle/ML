> Today I learned

Inspiration: 

I used to spend hours scouring the internet to solve errors or discover interesting concepts, but I often forgot what I learned because I didn't keep a collection of notes. One day, while searching for a solution to prevent my Google Colab session from getting disconnected and losing my progress, I stumbled upon a couple of repositories (repo by [Pushkar](https://github.com/thepushkarp/til) and [Josh Branchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til)) that inspired me to create my own collection of concise write-ups on the small things I learn day-to-day in technology.

[Josh Branchaud](https://joshbranchaud.com) referred to these as 'smart notes' in his [blog](https://dev.to/jbranchaud/how-i-built-a-learning-machine-45k9), while [Shawn @swyx Wang](https://www.swyx.io) mentioned in [Learning In Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public). This is precisely what I intend to do here.
