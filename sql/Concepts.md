## CTR- Click Through Rate
Click-Through Rate (CTR) is a common metric used in digital marketing and advertising to measure the effectiveness of an online campaign or the performance of a specific ad or link. It represents the percentage of people who click on a specific link (such as an ad or a call-to-action button) after viewing it.

The formula to calculate Click-Through Rate (CTR) is:
```
CTR = (Number of Clicks / Number of Impressions) x 100
```
where:

Number of Clicks: The total number of times users clicked on the link or ad.

Number of Impressions: The total number of times the link or ad was shown to users (i.e., the total number of views or exposures).
By multiplying the result by 100, we express the CTR as a percentage.

For example, if an ad was shown 1,000 times (impressions) and received 50 clicks, the CTR would be:
```
CTR = (50 / 1000) x 100 = 5%
```
A higher CTR indicates that a larger percentage of users who saw the link or ad found it compelling enough to click on it, which is generally a positive indicator of engagement and relevancy.

CTR is an essential metric for advertisers and marketers as it helps them assess the performance of their campaigns, optimize ad placements and content, and make informed decisions to improve conversion rates and overall campaign effectiveness. It is commonly used in various digital advertising platforms, including search engine advertising, display advertising, email marketing, and social media advertising.
